Questions:
- Can you give me a better understanding of <T>? As in like List<T> or ArrayList<T>? What is it again? I know its used, for instance, to be able to 
have both strings, integers, and objects in an ArrayList for example.
- Can you give me a crash course and rundown on generics, wrappers/wrapper types, <T> and related subjects in Java? I feel I get them mixed up often
and dont have a strong grasp and understanding of them. I would like to make sure I have these fundamentals down and reinforce my understanding.

- Teach me about the fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) as it relates to Java. Since I already work in Java for work, I believe I 
have a familiarty ingrained in me about the principles - but just to have the fundamentals enshrined and reinforced in my head can you give me a 
somewhat detailed crash course. Can you then also give me a rundown on what OOP principles or OOP related questions I can be asked in a SWE 1 or 2 
technical interview?
