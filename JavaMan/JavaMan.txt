Suggested Crash Course Order (Tailored to You)
Since you’re doing Java + algorithms, I recommend the following order:

✅ List / ArrayList (core to everything)
✅ Map / HashMap (for freq counters, lookups, memoization)
✅ Stack & Queue (essential for recursion, BFS, DFS)
✅ PriorityQueue (common in algo problems)
✅ TreeMap / TreeSet (for sorted key-value or sorted sets)
✅ LinkedList (not as useful in practice, but good to know)



General Topics

- Generics
- Autoboxing Unboxing

Lists/ArrayLists

- Lists - general
- ArrayLists - general
- instantiating a general defined list... List.of()... etc...

HashMaps

- Map (Collection) - general notes/understanding
- HashMap - general notes/understanding
  - Looping over a HashMap
    - // for (Character key : wordCharFreq.keySet()) {};
    - // for (Map.Entry<Character, Integer> entry : wordCharFreq.entrySet()) {};
