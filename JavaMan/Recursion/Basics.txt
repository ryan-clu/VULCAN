Recursion
---

Introduction
- Recursion is "a function calling itself"
- Iterative is "calling loops"

- Recursion is useful/can be useful for certain algorithm problems such as
for linked lists, trees, graphs, and dynamic programming.

Anatomy of a Recursive function:
(a) Base Case 
(b) Recursive Step

Time and Space Complexity
- Have to consider the number of function (recursive) calls made.
- Always 1+ function call for the base case O(n+1).
- Recursive calls are tracked in your computer's memory. Each call 
takes up space - on the call stack - they take up a stack frame.
- Have to consider the time and space implications for operations
performed in each recursive call as well.
